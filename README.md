Badge Hunters is demo multiplayer game for Windows, used as a course work.

Concepts: two players have to collect badges. Game ends when all badges on level were collected.
The one, who collected more badges is the winner. Players should avoid falling and cactuses -
they cause damage or kills. If player dies - he will be respawned on starting point.
